the purpose of redux middleware is to intercept an action before
it reaches the reducer

when a user interacts with the app and they click a button it will trigger
the ui to dispatch an action
instead of sending the action directly to the reducer, we send it to the middleware 

middleware sits in between the dispatching of the action and the reducer
once the middleware gets the action object - it has the freedom to do
that it once - performs extra logic etc.

middleware is a function that returns another function
